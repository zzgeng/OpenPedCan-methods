#### Data and code availability

Merged summary files for OpenPedCan v12 are openly accessible in [CAVATICA](https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/u/cavatica/opentarget) or via download script in the [https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis](https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis) repository.
Cancer group summary data are visible within the NCI's pediatric [Molecular Targets Platform](https://moleculartargets.ccdi.cancer.gov/) and cohort, cancer group, and individual data are visible within [PedcBioPortal](https://pedcbioportal.kidsfirstdrc.org/study/summary?id=openpedcan_v12)
